# Crypto Portfolio Tracker
This Python program allows you to input your public wallet addresses on (presently) two blockchains, Terra and Solana. Based on the input, the program queries public data sources for each wallet given and calculates the value of each wallet's holdings in USD. The program then prints the total value and a breakdown of the value by wallet, updating every 30 seconds.

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your wallet addresses and ask which blockchain each address is on. You have the option to save your addresses to a config file so you can run the program again without having to enter your addresses each time.
